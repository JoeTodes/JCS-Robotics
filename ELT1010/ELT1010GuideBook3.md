## More on Resistors

If wires are like 4-lane highways, resistors are like winding, bumpy, dirt roads; electrons can still travel through them, but have to take their time. This might be a bit of a misleading analogy though, because the resistor not only affects the speed of electrons while they travel through it, but the speed of **all** electrons everywhere in the resistor's circuit. Electrons are always in a bumper-to-bumper traffic jam, so they all move only as fast as the slowest ones

Another way to think about resitors is imagining electrical current like water flowing from your sink down to the sewer line. If the pipe is clean, the water can flow as fast as possible (thanks to gravity), but if there is a wad of cat hair stuck halfway down the pipe, not only will the water flow slowly through the hairball, but all of the water above the clog will also be moving slowly, and after the clog there will only be a trickle entering the sewer. In other words, stop letting the cat hang out in the sink.
