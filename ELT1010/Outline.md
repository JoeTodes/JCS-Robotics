5. Soldering
 
# Topics 
## Electricity 101
* electrons
* voltage
* electron flow vs conventional current
  

## First Circuit
  * Simple series circuit
  * Schematic diagrams
    * Battery symbol
    * conductor lines
  * Resistor (Symbol)
  * Breadboard
    * How they work
  * Power Supply (MB102) - Fill in Power Supply row in Components Worksheet
  * Construct simple circuit
  * Add LED
  
## Ohm's Law
  
  * Measure Vr and Vled
    * How to multimeter
    * Notice KVL
  * Measure I
    * How to
    * LED Max current
    * Current limiting resistor
  * Increase resistance
    * Notice LED is dimmer, so less current
  * Measure Vr and I to verify
    * Vr stayed the same, because of LED Forward Voltage
  * Ohm's Law
  * How much current would we get if R1 was 10k?

## More Kirchoff's Voltage Law
  * Series resistors (equal)
  * Measure I, calculate total Ohms
    * Resistors in series "look" like one resistor with sum of their ohms
  * Measure Vr1 and Vr2
    * Kirchoff's Voltage Law
  * Increase 1 resistor, remeasure V drops
  

## Kirchoff's Current Law
  * Parallel resistors and LEDs (equal)
  * Measure V drop across each resistor (reaffirm KVL)
  * Calculate expected I in each brach
  * Measure to verify
  * What is the I drawn from the power supply?
  * KCL
  * Change one resistor (big change to see noticable dimness)
  * No change to other branch (KVL)
  * Calculate and verify new I in changed branch
  * Calculate and Verify total I

## Potentiometers
  * Inside view
  * Schematic Symbol and breadboard use
  * Simple LED dimmer
    * why the other resistor?
  
## Switches
  * Simple switch circuit (Schematic Symbol and breadboard connection)
    * Tac Switch (off-(on))
    * Slide Switch (off-on)
  * Parallel circuit
    * Switch before/after branch
    * Switch on one branch

## Capacitors
  * Simple LED Fade circuit (Schematic Symbol and polarity)
  * Other uses
    * Filter power supply variance
    * AC-DC conversion
  
## Transistors
  * electrical switch
  * 2222 (NPN transistor Schematic Symbol and pinout)
  * only lets current flow from Collector to Emitter if Base is higher voltage than Emitter
  * Need resistor into Base to limit current
  * Potentiometer Controlled Transistor Circuit
  * What at what Veb does the 2222 'activate'?

## Soldering
  * How to and what is good
  * Practice on soldering kits

## Digital Logic Probe Project
  * What is a DLP?
  * Digital Logic Probe Circuit and explanation
  * Breadboard and test
  * Design enclosure in CAD to 3D Print
    * Protoboard Mounting
    * Nail end
    * LED mounts
    * 5V and GND wires
    * Assembly/Fastening (M2, M2.6, or M3 bolts w/ hex nut)
    * Drawing Sheets for Approval
  * Solder digital logic probe circuit on protoboard
