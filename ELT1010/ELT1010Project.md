## Objectives
Now that we've covered the fundamental concepts and components of electronics, it's time for a project. Below you will find a schematic for a circuit that causes two **LEDs** to flash alternately. This will be the basis for the project, which contains multiple steps. You will be making use of the following skills:

* Breadboarding
* Circuit Analysis
* Soldering
* CAD


Your tasks are as follows:

1. Construct the following circuit on your breadboard. You'll know you've done it correctly when the two LEDs take turns blinking. **Take a video of your working circuit on your phone**

2. The final product will be using a 3V battery, so test this circuit out using the **3.3V mode** on your **power supply** instead of **5V**. Switch modes by moving the yellow jumper clips over to the side labelled **3.3V**. Make sure to change both sides. **Adjust the values of the resistors and capacitors as needed to make the circuit work the way you want**
   
3. Add an **on-off switch** using your **slide switch**. This should turn off the entire circuit. **Take a picture of your breadboard layout and a video of your working circuit on your phone, inlcuding the on/off switch working**
   
4. Redraw the schematic diagram to include the **on-off switch** and any changes you made.
   
5. Swap your power supply for a **coin cell battery holder**, provided by your teacher. **Condense** your breadboarded circuit to the area available on your protoboard (**17 rows on either side of the gap, no rails**), including the battery holder.
    > NOTE: on the actual protoboard, the battery holder can be mounted on the back, freeing up space on the front

6. Starting with pencil and paper, plan a 3D printed enclosure to house your project. Your enclosure must have the following:
   * Made in two parts with holes for screws to attach together
   * Holes for the two **LEDs** and the **on-off switch**
   * Standoffs for the two mounting holes on the protoboard with holes for mounting screws
7. The following steps can be completed in any order:
   1. Design your enclosure in **Fusion 360**. Keep in mind the limitations of 3D printing. Create and submit a **2D drawing sheet** for approval before printing.
   2. Transfer your circuit to the protoboard and solder it. Other than the **LEDs** and **slide switch**, all components should be as low profile as possible. **Take a picture clearly showing your solder joints**

8. Once the enclosure is printed and finalized, assemble it all together.
